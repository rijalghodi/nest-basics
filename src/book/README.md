# BOOK MODULE - LEARN SERVICE & PROVIDER

Providers are plain JavaScript classes that are declared as providers in a module.
Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can be injected as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system.

  - @Injectable() decorator
    @Injectable() decorator adds metadata (additional information) to the tagged class. This metadata provides NestJS with information about how the class should be managed and used in the context of dependency injection.
